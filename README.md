> Teach your process to shutdown gracefully.

## Why?

 - Friendly to your users.
 - Easy to use and reason about.
 - Enables [zero-downtime](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/blob/ea406684a7ca29cc8a9214c7c6df938d5d6fab75/README.md#load-balancing--zero-second-downtime-reload) deployments.

## Install

```sh
npm install handle-quit --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const handleQuit = require('handle-quit');
```

Make sure your program shuts down gracefully or quickly, as necessary.

```js
handleQuit(() => {
	server.close();
});
```

## Use with PM2

Simply use `handleQuit()` in the main entry of your CLI or server as shown above and [graceful stop](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/signals-clean-restart/#graceful-stop) will automatically be enabled for your application. .

Just in case something goes wrong, `--kill-timeout` tells PM2 how long it should wait before assuming the app is dead.

Don't forget about graceful _start_, see [app-ready](https://github.com/sholladay/app-ready).

## API

### handleQuit(listener)

Listens for [SIGINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_signal#POSIX_signals) and runs a graceful shutdown on the first signal. Calls `process.exit(1)` upon any future SIGINT signals. Relevant shutdown messages are also printed to the console.

#### listener

Type: `function`

A function that will gracefully shutdown your program. A common example is [Server#close()](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_close_callback).
